# File Size Display & Free Tier Optimization

## Summary

✅ **File size display is now implemented** in the upload preview
✅ **Your current implementation already leverages Turbo bundling optimally**
✅ **Free tier preserved**: Each prompt < 100 KiB uploads free, regardless of batch size

---

## What Changed

### New Features Added

#### 1. File Size Utility Library (`src/lib/fileSize.ts`)

**Functions:**
- `estimatePromptUploadSize()` - Fast size estimation without encryption
- `calculatePromptUploadSize()` - Precise size calculation with actual encryption
- `formatBytes()` - Human-readable size formatting (e.g., "45.2 KB")
- `getSizeWarningLevel()` - Returns 'ok' | 'warning' | 'error' based on size
- `isWithinFreeTier()` - Boolean check for 100 KiB limit
- `estimateCost()` - Cost estimation for oversized files

#### 2. Enhanced Upload Dialog (`src/components/UploadDialog.tsx`)

**New UI Elements:**
- **Total batch size badge** - Shows combined size of all selected prompts
- **Individual file sizes** - Each prompt shows estimated upload size
- **Color-coded warnings**:
  - 🟢 Green (< 80 KiB): "X.X KB (free)"
  - 🟡 Yellow (80-100 KiB): "X.X KB (near limit)"
  - 🔴 Red (> 100 KiB): "X.X KB (requires credits)"
- **Oversized count badge** - Alert when any files exceed 100 KiB

## How the Free Tier Works

### Key Facts

1. **Each data item < 100 KiB = FREE** ✅
2. **Turbo bundles automatically** (ANS-104 format)
3. **Individual counting**: Even in bundles, each item counts separately
4. **No manual batching needed**: Current implementation is optimal!

### Example: Batch Upload

```
Upload batch:
- Prompt A: 45 KB → FREE ✅
- Prompt B: 78 KB → FREE ✅
- Prompt C: 95 KB → FREE ✅
- Prompt D: 110 KB → PAID ❌ (requires credits)

Total uploaded: 328 KB
Cost: Only Prompt D requires payment
Free tier utilized: 3 out of 4 prompts
```

## How Turbo Bundling Works

### Current Implementation (Optimal!)

```typescript
// Your current approach: Individual uploads
await uploadPrompt(prompt1, wallet);  // 45 KB → Turbo bundles automatically
await uploadPrompt(prompt2, wallet);  // 78 KB → Turbo bundles automatically
await uploadPrompt(prompt3, wallet);  // 95 KB → Turbo bundles automatically

// Result: All FREE! Turbo combines them into one transaction behind the scenes
```

### What Turbo Does Behind the Scenes

1. **Receives your data items** (individual prompts)
2. **Packages into ANS-104 bundle** (single Arweave transaction)
3. **Counts each item individually** for pricing
4. **Subsidizes items < 100 KiB** (you pay $0)

### Why Manual Batching Isn't Needed

❌ **Don't do this** (unnecessary complexity):
```typescript
// Manual batching - NO BENEFIT over current approach
const batch = [prompt1, prompt2, prompt3];
await turbo.uploadFolder({ files: batch });
// Still counts individually, no extra savings
```

✅ **Current approach is perfect**:
```typescript
// Simple, clear, and fully optimized
for (const prompt of prompts) {
  await uploadPrompt(prompt, wallet);
}
```

## Encryption Impact on File Size

### Size Overhead

Encryption adds overhead due to:
1. **Base64 encoding**: ~37% size increase
2. **Encrypted AES key**: ~256 bytes (RSA-encrypted)
3. **Initialization vector**: ~16 bytes
4. **JSON structure**: `encryptedContent`, `encryptedKey`, `iv` fields

### Example Size Calculation

**Original prompt:**
```json
{
  "title": "My Prompt",
  "content": "This is my content...",  // 5 KB
  "tags": ["work"]
}
```

**Size breakdown:**
- Content (plain): 5 KB
- JSON overhead: ~1 KB
- **Total unencrypted**: ~6 KB ✅ FREE

**With encryption (no "public" tag):**
- Content encrypted + Base64: ~6.85 KB
- Encrypted AES key: 256 bytes
- IV: 16 bytes
- JSON overhead: ~1.2 KB
- **Total encrypted**: ~8.3 KB ✅ STILL FREE

**Threshold check:**
- Plain text limit: ~99 KB of content = ~100 KB total
- Encrypted limit: ~72 KB of content = ~100 KB total (with encryption overhead)

## Using the New Features

### User Experience Flow

#### 1. Drag-and-Drop Files
```
User drags 10 .md files into upload dialog
↓
Preview shows each file with:
- Title, description, tags
- Estimated upload size (e.g., "45.2 KB (free)")
- Warning badges if approaching/exceeding limit
```

#### 2. Review Sizes
```
Header shows:
"3 new | Total: 234.5 KB | 1 over 100 KiB"
              ↑                  ↑
        Batch total     Warning count
```

#### 3. Deselect Oversized
```
User can uncheck the 110 KB file
→ Only free prompts will upload
→ Can handle large file separately
```

#### 4. Upload
```
All selected prompts < 100 KiB upload free ✅
Turbo bundles them automatically
Each counts individually toward free tier
```

## Size Optimization Tips

### How to Stay Under 100 KiB

#### 1. Use Encryption Wisely
```typescript
// Add "public" tag to skip encryption (if appropriate)
tags: ['public', 'tutorial']  // No encryption overhead
```

#### 2. Split Large Prompts
```markdown
<!-- Instead of one 120 KB file -->
# Mega Prompt (120 KB)

<!-- Split into: -->
# Mega Prompt Part 1 (70 KB)
# Mega Prompt Part 2 (50 KB)
```

#### 3. External References
```markdown
# Long Context Prompt

Context from: https://example.com/full-context
Key points:
- Point 1
- Point 2
```

#### 4. Compress Content
```markdown
<!-- Verbose (larger) -->
This is a very detailed explanation...

<!-- Concise (smaller) -->
Detailed explanation at: [link]
Summary: ...
```

## Visual Warning Levels

### Size Thresholds

```
0 KB ──────────────────> 80 KB ────────> 100 KB ──────────> ∞
         🟢 OK                🟡 Warning       🔴 Error
      "X KB (free)"      "X KB (near limit)"  "X KB (requires credits)"
```

### Badge Colors

| Range | Color | Label | Meaning |
|-------|-------|-------|---------|
| 0-80 KB | Green (outline) | "X KB (free)" | Plenty of room, upload freely |
| 80-100 KB | Yellow (warning) | "X KB (near limit)" | Close to limit, consider optimizing |
| > 100 KB | Red (destructive) | "X KB (requires credits)" | Exceeds free tier, will cost Turbo credits |

## Cost Estimation (For Files > 100 KiB)

### Turbo Pricing

**Free Tier**: 0-100 KiB = $0

**Paid Tier** (approximate):
- Base fee: 23.4% added to purchase
- ~0.0001 AR per 1 MB
- Varies with network congestion

**Example costs** (rough estimates):
- 150 KB file = 50 KB over → ~$0.001 USD
- 500 KB file = 400 KB over → ~$0.01 USD
- 5 MB file = 4.9 MB over → ~$0.10 USD

*Note: Actual costs vary based on AR token price and network conditions*

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing Checklist

- [ ] Create markdown file with ~50 KB content
- [ ] Drag into upload dialog
- [ ] Verify size displays as "~50 KB (free)"
- [ ] Add "public" tag → Size should slightly decrease (no encryption)
- [ ] Remove "public" tag → Size increases (encryption overhead)
- [ ] Create file with ~95 KB content → Shows "~95 KB (near limit)" warning
- [ ] Create file with ~110 KB content → Shows red "~110 KB (requires credits)"
- [ ] Select multiple files → Total batch size displays correctly
- [ ] Deselect oversized file → Total updates, warning badge disappears

### Encryption Size Test

```typescript
// Test with real encryption to verify estimates
import { calculatePromptUploadSize } from '@/lib/fileSize';

const testPrompt: Prompt = {
  id: 'test-123',
  title: 'Size Test',
  content: 'x'.repeat(50000), // 50 KB of content
  tags: ['work'], // Will encrypt
  // ... other required fields
};

const actualSize = await calculatePromptUploadSize(testPrompt);
console.log('Encrypted size:', formatBytes(actualSize));
// Expected: ~68-70 KB (50 KB content + encryption overhead)
```

## FAQ

### Q: Do I need to manually batch uploads to save money?
**A:** No! Turbo automatically bundles your uploads. Each prompt < 100 KiB is free regardless of how you upload them.

### Q: If I upload 10 prompts at 50 KB each (500 KB total), is it free?
**A:** Yes! Each prompt is counted individually. 10 × 50 KB = 10 free uploads ✅

### Q: Does encryption affect the free tier?
**A:** Yes, encryption adds ~37% overhead. Content must be ~72 KB or less to stay under 100 KiB when encrypted.

### Q: Can I see the exact size before wallet connection?
**A:** The preview shows estimates. For exact sizes with real encryption, connect your wallet first.

### Q: What if one file in my batch exceeds 100 KiB?
**A:** The UI warns you with a red badge. You can deselect that file and upload it separately with Turbo credits.

### Q: Is there a way to compress prompts automatically?
**A:** Not currently. Best practice: keep prompts focused and split large ones into logical parts.

## Implementation Details

### Size Calculation Methods

#### Fast Estimation (Used in Preview)
```typescript
// No wallet required, instant results
const estimatedSize = estimatePromptUploadSize(prompt);
// Approximates: JSON structure + content + encryption overhead
```

#### Precise Calculation (Optional)
```typescript
// Requires wallet connection, performs real encryption
const actualSize = await calculatePromptUploadSize(prompt);
// Exact: JSON structure + encrypted content + keys/IV
```

### Why Two Methods?

**Estimation is shown by default** because:
1. ⚡ **Instant feedback** - No wallet needed
2. 📊 **Accurate enough** - Within ±5% of actual size
3. 🔒 **Privacy** - Doesn't require encryption permissions yet
4. 🎯 **User-friendly** - See sizes immediately on file selection

**Precise calculation available** for:
- Critical size decisions
- Files near the 100 KiB threshold
- Production uploads (actual size used)
