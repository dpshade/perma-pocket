- [ ] All permissions are clearly listed
- [ ] Wallet connects successfully
- [ ] User address displays in UI

**Notes:**
_Record any permission issues or errors here_

## 2. Encryption on Upload

### Test: Upload Prompt WITHOUT "public" Tag (Should Encrypt)

**Steps:**
1. Create new prompt with title "Private Test Prompt"
2. Add content: "This is private content that should be encrypted"
3. Add tags: `work`, `draft` (NO "public" tag)
4. Click "Upload to Arweave"
5. Wait for transaction confirmation
6. Check console for logs

**Expected Result:**
- [ ] Console shows: Encryption started
- [ ] No errors in console
- [ ] Transaction successfully uploaded
- [ ] Prompt appears in list with lock icon üîí
- [ ] Transaction ID is displayed

**Verify on Arweave:**
1. Copy transaction ID
2. Go to ViewBlock: `https://viewblock.io/arweave/tx/{TX_ID}`
3. Check transaction data

**Expected on ViewBlock:**
- [ ] Content is encrypted (not readable plain text)
- [ ] Tags include: `Pocket-Prompt-v2`, `Content-Type: application/json`
- [ ] Data structure shows `encryptedContent`, `encryptedKey`, `iv`, `isEncrypted: true`

**Note:** Protocol v2 uses session-based encryption - you'll only sign once per session!

## 10. Security Verification

### Test: Encrypted Data is Truly Encrypted

**Steps:**

2. Copy transaction ID
3. Use Arweave GraphQL to fetch raw data:
   ```graphql
   query {
     transaction(id: "TX_ID") {
       data
     }
   }
   ```

**Expected Result:**
- [ ] Raw data is base64 encoded
- [ ] Decoded data shows encrypted structure (not plain text)
- [ ] Cannot read content without wallet private key

---

### Test: Different Wallets Cannot Decrypt Each Other's Content

**Prerequisites:**
- 2 different Arweave wallets
